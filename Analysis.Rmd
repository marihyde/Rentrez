```{r}
Sequences<-read.csv("Sequences.csv")
print(Sequences)
```

Counting base pairs: 

```{r}

count_bases <- function(Sequences) {
  A <- sum(strsplit(Sequences, "")[[1]] == "A")
  T <- sum(strsplit(Sequences, "")[[1]] == "T")
  C <- sum(strsplit(Sequences, "")[[1]] == "C")
  G <- sum(strsplit(Sequences, "")[[1]] == "G")
return(data.frame(A = A, T = T, C = C, G = G))
}

base_counts <- do.call(rbind, lapply(Sequences$Sequence, count_bases))
base_counts <- cbind(Sequences$Name, base_counts)
colnames(base_counts) <- c("Sequence ID", "A", "T", "C", "G")
print(base_counts) 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
